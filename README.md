# Software Component & Networks based on Hypergraphs

Library based on hypergraphs to represent and handle software component &amp; network models
The main superclasses are

* Algorithm
* Interface
    - Input
    - Output
* Type

## State

* Similar to the hwgraph library

## ToDo

* Extend the tests
* Add another domain to encode finite state machines ... with them it is possible to express algorithm internal behavior
